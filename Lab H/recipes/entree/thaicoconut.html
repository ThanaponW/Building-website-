    <h1 class="top">Thai Coconut Soup (Tom Kha Kai) </h1>
<hr>
    <p>Thai tom kha gai is a popular Thai soup, that's eaten more like a curry. The base of the dish is coconut milk, so it's creamy and rich. It's not known as being a spicy Thai dish, but it's still full of delicious and well balanced flavor.</p>

      <ol class="sectionContent">
		  <li>First take a thumb sized chunk of galangal, cut off the stems, and cut the root part into thin slices. It can be a little tough, so you might have to hit the top of your knife with your palm.</li>
		  <li>Next grab your lemongrass, slice off the bottoms, pull off the outer skin layer, and then slice it diagonally into about 1 inch strips. This is just going to help release its amazing fragrance.</li>
		  <li>Turn on your stove to medium heat, and add about 3 cups (or ½) of the coconut milk to a medium sized saucepan. Put the pot on the heat and immediately toss in the sliced galangal and lemongrass.</li>
		  <li>As your coconut milk begins to heat, move back over to your cutting board and slice up the chicken. I used 2 chicken breasts for this recipe. Slice the chicken into medium sized chunks - they can be kind of big in size.</li>
		  <li>Just before the coconut milk comes to a boil, add the chicken, and then add the other remaining 3 cups of coconut milk. Now, turn down the heat to a medium low, as you don’t want the coconut milk to heat too fast or burn.</li>
		  <li>Prepare your Thai chilies by peeling off the stems and then just slice them diagonally. Go ahead and add them directly to the soup.</li>
		  <li>Give the soup a quick stir, and then add about 200 grams of oyster mushrooms (it was about 2 handfuls for me).</li>
		  <li>Your coconut milk should not boil, but just maintain a nice low heat. Because coconut milk is so delicate, when you stir, be sure to move your spoon in 1 direction only, otherwise you run the risk of the coconut milk getting too shaken and it will start to curdle. Be gentle with the coconut milk.</li>
		  <li>Move back over to your cutting board and peel and slice 2 small white onions into thick wedges (if your onion is really big, just use 1). Immediately toss the onions into the soup.</li>
		  <li>Next, cut your tomatoes in the same way as your onions, into thick wedges. Wait until your tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่) is just about to boil, and then add the tomatoes.</li>
		  <li>Take the kaffir lime leaves, break them with your hand, and toss them directly into the soup. Breaking the kaffir lime leaves is going to release their flavor.</li>
		  <li>Now add about ½ teaspoon of salt to begin with (taste to add more)</li>
		  <li>Mix your tom kha gai slowly and gently, for about 5 - 10 minutes, making sure it doesn’t come to a full boil - and if it does - turn down the heat to even lower. You want the chicken, onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients to be fully cooked, but you don’t want to overcook the coconut milk.</li>
		  <li>After about 5 - 10 minutes of cooking, go ahead and turn off the heat completely.</li>
		  <li>Go back to your cutting board, slice up a handful of fresh cilantro, and add it to the soup. Give it a quick stir, and the cilantro will cook enough from the already hot soup.</li>
		  <li>The final step is to juice a couple of limes into a separate bowl and then add about 4 tablespoons of lime juice to the tom kha gai. Again, just give it a quick and gentle stir, and it’s ready to be served.</li>
		  <li>Make sure you do some taste-testing to make sure it’s salty and sour enough. You may need to add a little extra salt or lime juice to get the flavor you want.</li>
